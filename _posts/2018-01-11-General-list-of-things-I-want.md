Front-end layout change
  Note: Tabs should only be "Home", "Résumé", and "Blog".
        Résumé tab should link to pdf view of résumé with download link. Eventually learn how to implement
        front-end design to beautify sliding transitions between blocks of information: 
        
        Block #1: Self introduction
        Block #2: Projects (along with date and description; should be more than that on résumé
        Block #3: List of skills and familiar software
        
        No idea how to go about deciding on a layout. I do, however, want each block to fade away as they disappear
        away from the center, and fade in when entering into the center. Preferably a dark tone for background color.
        
First list on agenda: Decide on main page layout. Then incorporate format into GitHub and test compatibility with 
aforementioned layout details.
